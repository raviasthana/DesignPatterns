Any Downsides??
----------------

Overuse of the Open/Closed principle can lead to abstract and complex code. 
This principle should really only be used in places where code is least likely to change. 
 
Decorators can lead to a system with a lot of smaller objects that will look similar to a 
developer and introduce a maintenance headache.
