Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of 
the class exists per JVM. The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the 
instance of the class. Singleton pattern can be used for logging, driver objects, caching and 
thread pool.

Singleton design pattern is also used in other design patterns like Abstract Factory, Builder, 
Prototype, Facade etc. Singleton design pattern is used in core java classes also, 
for example java.lang.Runtime, java.awt.Desktop.
