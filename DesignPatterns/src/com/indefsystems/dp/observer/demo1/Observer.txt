Observer pattern is quite common in GUI applications and in/with event driven programming.

Observer pattern mainly involves two entities. A SUBJECT and an OBSERVER.
OBSERVER registers itself with the SUBJECT showing interest in an EVENT which SUBJECT
may fire at a random time requiring OBSERVER to perform certain activities.
